## Concepts
Sources
Information
Evidence
Analysis/Assessment
Assertion/Conclusion

Sources (containers) hold Information (content). Sources have provenance (original, derived, authored) and informants. Information has varying quality based on informant and source context (primary, secondary, indeterminable).
Information items correlate to form Evidence of an Assertion or Conclusion. Evidence has three modes (direct, indirect or negative) based on how strongly it informs the Assertion. Assertions are inferred from Analysis and Assessment of all Evidence and the corresponding source provenance, information quality and evidence mode.
